A Spotify Clone work in progress


The frontend is React + TypeScript with Zustand for lightweight global state, Tailwind + shadcn UI for styling,
and a resizable menu layout. The backend is Node/Express with MongoDB for persistence, 
and I seed structured album/song data. Itâ€™s organized with modular routing, controllers, and middleware, 
and ready to expand into real playback and playlists.
