A Spotify Clone work in progress

The frontend is React + TypeScript with Zustand for lightweight global state, Tailwind + shadcn UI for styling, and a resizable menu layout.
The backend is Node/Express with MongoDB for persistence, and I seed structured album/song data. 
Itâ€™s organized with modular routing, controllers, and middleware, and ready to expand into real playback and playlists.


To run in its current state: 
  -in backend, run "npm run dev"
  -in frontend, run "npm run dev"

Only my admin account can add/remove songs for now.
